Additional Notes:
* Keep the UI minimal and clean to avoid overwhelming users.
* Ensure the AI analysis section has clear visual cues when insights are updated.
* Use tagging and categorization to make it easy to find related pain points and insights.
Please make sure the transcription logic is according to OpenAI:
Create transcription post
https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions Transcribes audio into the input language.
Request body file file
Required The audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm.
model string
Required ID of the model to use. The options are gpt-4o-transcribe, gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, and whisper-1 (which is powered by our open source Whisper V2 model).
include[] array
Optional Additional information to include in the transcription response. logprobs will return the log probabilities of the tokens in the response to understand the model's confidence in the transcription. logprobs only works with response_format set to json and only with the models gpt-4o-transcribe and gpt-4o-mini-transcribe.
language string
Optional The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 (e.g. en) format will improve accuracy and latency.
prompt string
Optional An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The prompt should match the audio language.
response_format string
Optional Defaults to json The format of the output, in one of these options: json, text, srt, verbose_json, or vtt. For gpt-4o-transcribe and gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, the only supported format is json.
stream boolean or null
Optional Defaults to false If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events. See the Streaming section of the Speech-to-Text guide for more information.
Note: Streaming is not supported for the whisper-1 model and will be ignored.
temperature number
Optional Defaults to 0 The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.
timestamp_granularities[] array
Optional Defaults to segment The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. response_format must be set verbose_json to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: word, or segment. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.
Returns The transcription object, a verbose transcription object or a stream of transcript events.
Default
Streaming
Logprobs
Word timestamps
Segment timestamps Example request curl https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F file="@/path/to/file/audio.mp3" -F model="gpt-4o-transcribe" Response { "text": "Imagine the wildest idea that you've ever had, and you're curious about how it might scale to something that's a 100, a 1,000 times bigger. This is a place where you can get to do that." }
Make sure to use gpt-4o-transcribe as the model. Make sure the app supports all the file types openai support for file uplodas. Make sure to use the response_format that is best suitable for our app and the way we store and display the transcript. Use en for language. The file size cap for the transciption API is 25MB so enfore that when users uploads files to the app. make sure the entire platform supports the changes you will implement.
Let the user input his openai api key from his settings. is it store (minimally) secured, properly use the user key for ALL requests done to openai on his behalf. use his key only for his requests and not for other users, Use his key and not a general system key.
allow the user to upload a recording even if he didnâ€™t create a meeting in the platform from before, just ask him the data you need at that moment like when was it and what contact was it with, if the user didn't upload a contact even then ask it when you need to create a contact for him so you can create a meeting and let him upload the recording. Same thing if he wants to create a meeting but didn't create a contact yet, just ask him what you need to create the contact as well so it can create the meeting.
Remember the user with create scheduled meetings that didnâ€™t happen yet or a meeting that happened and can upload recordings or his notes anytime.
Allow the user to upload meeting notes if he doesn't have a recording, and make he can upload notes even if he did upload a recording. and do the same flow, generate summary, painpoints, root causes, etc.
Add company as entity so we can have context about the company for when we try to see align pain points - and different ICP and different companies can have different solutions to the same pain points
Make sure everything is setup with a DB

This is an MVP, everything should work but keep feature minimal.

We don't need industry for the contact if we have it in the company. Make sure you align the entire code base and db. Allow the user to specifcy a company industry and a contact role when the user chooses Other, and then add it as an option for always for the user when he creates future companies and contacts, so we can later show the common pain points across his chosen industries and job titles. But add those only for that user. Make the needed changes in the DB.

*To be done soon:*

Edit contacts.
Log out button doesn't work.
The user icon on the top right shows a hard coded email and a blank circle. Put the first letter of the user's name and if no name defined email. and use his real email when he clicks on it.


Allow the user to add industries and roles to the predefined list



Go over every meetings and give the founder, user, feedback, if needed, on how he should implement the mom test principles more, create less bias, ask one question in a time, as open ended follow up questions, to get to the deeper root cause of the pain, get as much details on the pains, let the other person talk and give information based on what they think, etc.

Integrate to calendar to allow the user to add meetings from there to the platform with contacts from invite. Even join as agent to call and get transcription from there.

Optionally allow meeting in foreign language and translate them to English - the user should say what language was used in the call and a different transaction api call from openai should be used:Create translation

Does the search at the top right work?



status of meetings, if it's past the date, it should be shown as past, etc.

Allow adding meeting notes after meeting is created and recording is uploaded - allow notes at any stage.

Why are we allowing multiple recordings to be uploaded? allow one and tell the user if he uploads another one, it will replace the previous one.

After we already 


feedback on all buttons for loading.

As this is an MVP I want you to remove these from the frontend: Data export (Export Insights at /insights, At account tab and API Configuration tab under /settings), notifications, configuration of auto-generate transcripts and auto-analyze converstaions


Don't direct user to transcription page.


Let's show graph of meetings over time


future directions:
prep for call - prepare script
salesops - follow up
enrich company data from internet
automaticlly research solutions (competitors) that address common pain points.
